Here we will outline the project for my costume for Halloween 2016.

## 2016 Update
Project complete! Wore this with a wand I created for trick-or-treating! I got lots of compliments.

Also, I showed this off for my extended family at Thanksgiving. There were tons of new faces there but I was brave with my cape on! :-)

## 2017 Update
I still wear this cape when I get a chance. It's holding up nicely. I have changed the batteries.
When my dad took a new job I wore it to a company party we were invited to and was excited to share what I learned making it.

## Feature Roadmap
- Add sound
- Link with your magic wand
